                    Cricket is a team sport played with a bat and ball between two teams of eleven players each. The
                    game is played on an oval-shaped field with a pitch at the center. The objective is to score runs by
                    hitting the ball and running between the wickets or by hitting boundaries (four or six runs). One
                    team bats while the other bowls and fields, trying to dismiss the batsmen by various means such as
                    bowling them out, catching, or running them out. Matches can last from a few hours (Twenty20) to
                    several days (Test cricket). Cricket is popular worldwide, especially in countries like India,
                    England, Australia, and Pakistan. </p>
